    "description": "Many founders build products in isolation, only to discover there was no real demand. This platform allows users to post startup ideas and receive structured feedback from builders, operators, and domain experts. Instead of shallow likes, ideas are evaluated on feasibility, market size, originality, and execution difficulty. Over time, strong ideas surface while weak ones are refined or discarded early, saving founders time and energy.",
