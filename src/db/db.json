      "summary": "Monetize unused garage space for storage, parking, or work.",
      "description": "In many cities, garage space sits unused while people struggle to find affordable parking or storage. This idea proposes a peer-to-peer marketplace where homeowners can rent out their garages for multiple use cases: car parking, bike storage, seasonal storage, or even compact workspaces for creators. The platform would handle trust issues through identity verification, insurance coverage, smart-lock access, and user ratings. Over time, it could integrate city zoning rules, dynamic pricing based on demand, and partnerships with logistics companies. The goal is to turn wasted residential space into a flexible, income-generating asset while easing urban congestion.",

      "description": "Modern food systems often disconnect people from where their food comes from, while local farmers struggle with unpredictable income. This subscription service directly links nearby farms with urban households through weekly or bi-weekly produce boxes. Customers receive seasonal, fresh food, while farmers gain stable demand and fair pricing. The platform could include farm stories, sustainability metrics, customizable boxes, and flexible delivery schedules. Long-term, it becomes not just a logistics service, but a trust-based local food network that strengthens regional agriculture.",

It gives freelancers a single dashboard to track income, manage contracts, send invoices, estimate taxes, and monitor expenses. Instead of behaving like a bloated CRM, it stays lightweight and opinionated. Over time, it could introduce automation for reminders, regional tax rules, and income forecasting—helping freelancers think like business owners, not just workers.",
